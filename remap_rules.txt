# Atlas Spiderweb Remap Rules (Inference‑Heavy)
#
# Only a small subset of TABLEs and one VIEW are explicitly remapped.
# All other object types must be inferred from dependencies.

# ORA_APP tables split across multiple target schemas
ORA_APP.ORDER_HDR      = OB_SALES.ORDER_HDR
ORA_APP.ORDER_LINE     = OB_SALES.ORDER_LINE
ORA_APP.SHIPMENT       = OB_LOG.SHIPMENT

# ORA_FIN tables remapped to finance target
ORA_FIN.PAYMENT        = OB_FIN.PAYMENT
ORA_FIN.REFUND         = OB_FIN.REFUND

# Only one analytics view is explicitly remapped (override inference)
ORA_BI.VW_ORDER_SUMMARY = OB_ANALYTICS.VW_ORDER_SUMMARY
