## 1. Implementation
- [x] Move the runner and case assets into `compatibility_suite/runner/` and `compatibility_suite/cases/`.
- [x] Re-home proposal docs and SQL drafts into `compatibility_suite/docs/` and `compatibility_suite/sql/`.
- [x] Update the runner to drop suite config keys, fix paths, and emit `|`-delimited case details.
- [x] Update suite docs and case README to point at the new layout.
